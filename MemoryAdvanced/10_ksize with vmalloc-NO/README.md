## 1.Can I use ksize with vmalloc 📘🔍
**ksize()** is a function in the Linux kernel that returns the actual amount of memory (in bytes) allocated for a given pointer. This is especially useful because memory allocators might provide more memory than requested due to alignment, the size of allocation blocks, etc. 

Regarding your question, **"Can I use ksize with vmalloc?"**, the short answer is **no**. This is because `ksize` is applicable to memory allocated by `kmalloc`, `kmem_cache_alloc`, and similar functions. It is not designed to work with memory allocated by `vmalloc`.


### 2. Curious Questions 🧐🕵️‍♂️

#### Q1: How does ksize Determine the Size of an Allocated Memory Block?
🅰️: `ksize` works with the memory allocation mechanisms like `kmalloc` and determines the actual amount of memory allocated by checking the metadata of the allocation, which might be more than requested due to reasons like alignment and minimum allocation size.

#### Q2: What is the Primary Difference between kmalloc and vmalloc in Terms of Allocated Memory?
🅰️: `kmalloc` allocates contiguous physical and virtual memory, while `vmalloc` only assures contiguous virtual memory, mapping it to potentially non-contiguous physical memory. This makes `vmalloc` suited for larger allocations but may introduce an overhead due to page table lookups during address translation.

#### Q3: Why is it Not Suitable to Use ksize with vmalloc?
🅰️: `ksize` is designed for use with memory allocators that provide contiguous physical memory (like `kmalloc`), and its internal implementation is based on these allocators’ metadata structures. `vmalloc`, with its different memory allocation and mapping mechanism, is not compatible with `ksize`, leading to unreliable outputs.

### 3. Simplifying the Concept 🎨🍎
Imagine you're shopping for fruits 🍇🍉🍍. 

- **Using ksize = Asking for the basket’s actual capacity**: Imagine the `kmalloc` like a basket 🧺 of fruits that you bought. The space is physically continuous, and you can ask the seller (using `ksize`) how many more fruits could still fit in, even if you asked just for 5 apples 🍏.

- **Using vmalloc = Using several small baskets**: When you can't find a single big basket for all your fruits, you decide to use several smaller baskets. The `vmalloc` is like using several small baskets 🧺🧺🧺 (non-contiguous physical space) but putting them in a single line in your car 🚗 (contiguous virtual space). Asking how much you could still fit in a single basket using `ksize` wouldn’t work here since we are using multiple smaller baskets.

Hence, it’s like asking the seller about basket capacity when you’re not using a single basket but combining several. The seller (ksize) doesn’t know how to respond because it’s not designed for this complex setup. 🤷‍♂️🛒🚗

Hope this simplification aids in cementing the concept in your memory! 🧠💡 Best of luck with your preparation! 🚀📘
