### 1. Detailed Explanation 📘

- **High Memory Region**: 🚀
  - Defined as the top 128 MB of the kernel address space.
  - Serves as a temporary mapping space for the kernel.
  
- **Usage and Necessity**: 🗂️
  - **Why?** Physical memory above 1 GB (more precisely above 896 MB) needs a way to be accessed.
  - **How?** It uses the 128 MB high memory region to temporarily map it.
  
- **Mapping Mechanics**: 🗺️
  - **Dynamic Mapping**: Maps and unmaps physical memory dynamically, enabling access to all physical pages.
  - **High Memory Access Speed**: Access tends to be slower due to the on-the-fly creation and destruction of mappings.
  
- **64-bit Systems Scenario**: 🖥️
  - High memory concept is absent due to the vastly larger address space (2^64).
  - The conventional 3G/1G (Kernel/User space) memory split isn't applicable or necessary.

### 2. Curious Questions 🧐

- **Q1**: What is the high memory region and why is it used in kernel address space?
  - **A1**: The high memory region is the top 128 MB of the kernel address space, used to temporarily map physical memory above 896 MB to ensure the kernel can access all physical pages by creating temporary mappings in its virtual address space.
    
- **Q2**: Why is access to high memory slower compared to the regular memory access?
  - **A2**: Access to high memory is slower because the mapping to access it is created and destroyed on the fly by the kernel, which involves additional overhead and thus, reduced speed.

- **Q3**: Explain why the concept of high memory does not exist in 64-bit systems?
  - **A3**: In 64-bit systems, due to the significantly larger address range of 2^64, the traditional 3G/1G memory split doesn't make sense, and thus, the concept of high memory is not applicable or required.
    
### 3. Simplified Concept 🎈

- **High Memory**: 🗄️
  - Think of it like a "temporary storage desk" where the computer’s “brain” (the kernel) can quickly store and access stuff (data) that is above its usual reach (above 896 MB of physical memory).
  
- **Why Use It**: 🤔
  - Imagine having a tall shelf (memory above 896 MB) and needing a step stool (the high memory region) to reach items on the top because your arms (regular memory access) aren’t long enough.
  
- **64-bit Systems**: 🎉
  - Visualize a massive warehouse (2^64 address range) where you can walk (access memory) endlessly without needing a stool (high memory concept) because everything is within an easy reach due to the enormous space.
